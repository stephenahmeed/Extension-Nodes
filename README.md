# Extension-nodes

The exclusive alpha is all about using a browser on a VPS. Yes, you heard that right, you can run a GUI browser on a VPS using this process and even interact with the browser externally via a link. 

So, what are the benefits of running a browser on a VPS? Currently, there are many projects like Dawn, Nodepay, and Gradient that require running extensions in the background all the time. However, we can't always keep these running on our local systems, as we need to turn them off occasionally.

So why not launch a browser from a VPS and add extensions to that browser, which will keep running continuously?
